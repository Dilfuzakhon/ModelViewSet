# ModelViewSet Django Project

## Description

This is a Django-based project called **ModelViewSet**. It consists of several applications such as `dashboard` and `config`, each serving different parts of the project. The project uses a Model-View-Set architecture and includes basic models like `Faculty`, `Department`, `Group`, `Subject`, `Teacher`, and `Student`. Each model is structured using a `BaseModel` for created and updated timestamps, and relationships are established with proper `related_name` attributes for ease of querying.

## Features

- Faculty and Department relationship management.
- Group and Department-based student management.
- Subject assignment to teachers.
- REST framework integration for building APIs.
